# PRODIGY_CS_02
# Image Encryption and Decryption

This project provides a simple Python script that allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using the XOR operation on pixel values. The script uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate images.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

You can install Pillow using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Encrypt an Image:** The script applies an XOR operation on each pixel value with a specified key, creating an encrypted version of the image.
- **Decrypt an Image:** The script reverses the XOR operation to restore the original image from the encrypted version.

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Encrypt an Image

To encrypt an image, use the `encrypt_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image

def encrypt_image(input_image_path, output_image_path, key):
    # Open the image
    image = Image.open(input_image_path)
    pixels = list(image.getdata())
    
    # Encrypt the image by applying a simple operation on each pixel value
    encrypted_pixels = [(pixel[0] ^ key, pixel[1] ^ key, pixel[2] ^ key) for pixel in pixels]

    # Create a new image with the encrypted pixel values
    encrypted_image = Image.new(image.mode, image.size)
    encrypted_image.putdata(encrypted_pixels)
    encrypted_image.save(output_image_path)
    print(f"Image encrypted and saved to {output_image_path}")
```

Example usage:

```python
key = 123  # Simple key for XOR operation
encrypt_image('input.jpg', 'encrypted_image.png', key)
```

### 2. Decrypt an Image

To decrypt an image, use the `decrypt_image` function:

```python
def decrypt_image(encrypted_image_path, output_image_path, key):
    # Open the encrypted image
    image = Image.open(encrypted_image_path)
    pixels = list(image.getdata())
    
    # Decrypt the image by applying the reverse operation on each pixel value
    decrypted_pixels = [(pixel[0] ^ key, pixel[1] ^ key, pixel[2] ^ key) for pixel in pixels]

    # Create a new image with the decrypted pixel values
    decrypted_image = Image.new(image.mode, image.size)
    decrypted_image.putdata(decrypted_pixels)
    decrypted_image.save(output_image_path)
    print(f"Image decrypted and saved to {output_image_path}")
```

Example usage:

```python
decrypt_image('encrypted_image.png', 'decrypted_image.png', key)
```

### 3. Full Example

Here's a complete example of how to use both functions:

```python
key = 123  # Simple key for XOR operation
encrypt_image('input.jpg', 'encrypted_image.png', key)
decrypt_image('encrypted_image.png', 'decrypted_image.png', key)
```
